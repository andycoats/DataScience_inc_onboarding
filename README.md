Predicting customer demand to help manage inventory and resources appropriately is a challenging problem. In this project, we use data from pickups made by Uber in New York City to create a model to predict demand given the time and location.

There will be three parts to this demo:
1. Analysis and publishing
2. Scheduling
3. Deploying the model as an API

#### Analysis and publishing
In this part of the session we'll perform an analysis and then publish these findings as an easily-consumable Report for collaborators and business users.

Procedure:
1. Import modules for our analysis. Some of these come pre-installed in the DataScience Cloud environment. For the rest, we will install them using `install.packages()`. 
2. Load our data.
3. Run some analyses.
4. Publish the resulting analysis as an attractive Report.

#### Scheduling
Next, weâ€™ll show you how to schedule a job so that you can easily automate processes that need to happen on a regular basis (like ingestion of new training data, batch data transformations, and updated predictions).

#### Deploying the model as an API
Last (but definitely not least), we'll deploy a model that predicts the expected demand given a time, date, and location. By deploying the model as an API anyone in the organization with an API key can query it, including any apps that the engineering team has developed.
